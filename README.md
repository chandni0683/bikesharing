# bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. For this analysis, we have used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we have created a set of visualizations to:

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results
1. The total number of rides in the month of August was 2,344,224.

## Summary
From the above results and the additional data visualization done in the module as well as challenge, it appears that the bike commute is mostly done by the male subscribers. It also appears that the bikesharing services are mostly popular in densly populated areas lke metropolitan areas.
The two addditional visualizations that can be done in my opinions would be:
1.
