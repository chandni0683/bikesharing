# bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. For this analysis, we have used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, we have created a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, we have added these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
